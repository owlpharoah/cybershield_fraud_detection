- Enhanced CSS styling for fraud detection
- Updated risk level calculations
- Improved visual feedback

#### **test_model.py**

- Added more comprehensive test cases
- Enhanced risk level display

#### **New Files**
- `test_threshold.py` - Demonstrates new threshold logic
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

### 🎓 **Why This Change?**

**Senior Dev Explanation**: The original model was being too conservative, rarely flagging transactions as fraud even when they had high risk indicators. This made the system less useful for real-world fraud detection.

**The 50% threshold makes more sense because:**
1. **Intuitive**: 50% means "more likely fraud than not"
2. **Actionable**: Gives clear guidance for manual review
3. **Balanced**: Not too sensitive, not too conservative
4. **Transparent**: Easy to understand and explain

### 📊 **Impact**

#### **Before (Model Default)**
- Most transactions marked as "legitimate"
- Low fraud detection rate
- Conservative approach

#### **After (50% Threshold)**
- More transactions flagged for review
- Better balance of sensitivity
- Clear visual indicators
- More actionable results

### 🚀 **Deployment Ready**

All changes are committed and ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment:
- ✅ Updated logic tested
- ✅ Visual improvements implemented
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Git repository ready

**Next Steps**: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud to see the new logic in action!
